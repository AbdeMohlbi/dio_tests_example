# dio_tests_example

A reference repository containing **examples of testing Dio in Flutter**.  
This repository is designed as a **resource** for writing unit tests, handling fake responses, simulating timeouts, and managing unexpected JSON structures.

## Purpose

- Provide **reusable patterns** for testing Dio-based API services.  
- Include **fake HTTP adapters** for deterministic, network-independent tests.  
- Demonstrate testing of:
  - Success responses
  - Server errors
  - Timeouts
  - Unexpected JSON or malformed responses
